## What this is

The typed entry point an app writes once per entity, co-located with its aggregate. It knows the
entity's key format and hides the TanStack alpha entirely: `createCollection`,
`persistedCollectionOptions`, `createBrowserWASQLitePersistence`, the `sync` begin/write/commit
loop, catchup, and the durable cursor. Its return value is the hero **`LiveCollection<T>`** — a
TanStack `Collection` that the UI reads via `useLiveQuery` and the `SyncDispatcher` writes via its
`utils`.

**Inclusion test.** An item belongs in this bucket iff it is *frontend* plumbing that touches
TanStack DB or the persisted base. Anything pure-contract is protocol (Bucket 0); anything that
needs a server is the backend (Bucket C).

**The deletion test.** Delete the factory and every entity re-wires `createCollection` +
`persistedCollectionOptions` + the sync loop + the SyncWrite adapter by hand — the alpha surface
leaks into N entity files. Complexity reappears N× → the factory is deep, and earns the seam.

## Module layout

```
packages/live-collection/src/
  persistence/
    live-collection.ts      §1  LiveCollection<T> — the return type (a Collection, utils-hosted SyncWrite)
    effect-collection.ts    §2  effectCollectionOptions(...) — the factory
    schema-version.ts       §2  deriveSchemaVersion(schema) — FNV-1a of String(schema.ast) → uint32
    persistence-base.ts     §3  PersistenceBase tag + layerSqliteDriver (core-only imports — node-safe)
    persistence-base-opfs.ts §3 PersistenceBase.layer (browser OPFS) — the ONLY module importing wa-sqlite
    sync-session.ts         §4  the holder that lets utils.writeSynced reach the sync loop's write()
  dispatch/                     (built) — §1 relocates its SyncWrite access to `.utils`
  registry/                     (built) — make returns LiveCollection<T>; teardown via addFinalizer
```

> **Platform split (Phase-3 structural rule).** The OPFS layer pulls `@tanstack/browser-db-sqlite-persistence`
> (peer: wa-sqlite, browser-only). It must live in its **own module** so the node:sqlite gate test —
> importing the `PersistenceBase` tag + `layerSqliteDriver` (core-only) — never loads wa-sqlite, and the
> browser bundle never loads `node:sqlite`. The shared tag stays import-clean; each layer carries its
> platform deps. (Same reason the playground, not the test, owns the OPFS wiring.)

Dependencies designed in later passes, referenced here only as tags:
`BootstrapSource` (full-list refetch), `CatchupClient`, `LastSyncIdStore`, `SyncTransport`.
The source strategy is **snapshot-and-tail**, not catchup-from-zero — see DEC-A12.

## §1 — `LiveCollection<T>` (the return surface)

```typescript
import type { Collection } from "@tanstack/db"
import type { ModelId } from "@triargos/live-collection-protocol"
import type { SyncWrite } from "../dispatch/sync-write.js"

/**
 * The hero type. NOT a wrapper — it *is* a TanStack `Collection` whose key is `ModelId` and whose
 * `utils` host the server-truth write path. The UI reads it directly (`useLiveQuery(collection)`);
 * the `SyncDispatcher` reaches the synced-write path through `collection.utils`.
 *
 * `Collection<T, TKey, TUtils, TSchema, TInsertInput>`:
 *   - TKey   = ModelId      (branded string; assignable to TanStack's `string | number`)
 *   - TUtils = SyncWrite<T> (writeSynced / deleteSynced — hosted in utils, not bolted alongside)
 *   - TSchema = never       (schema-less overload — see DEC-A1: data is already decoded+branded
 *                            at the dispatch seam, so TanStack does no validation of its own)
 */
export type LiveCollection<T extends object> = Collection<T, ModelId, SyncWrite<T>, never, T>
```

**Relocation of the dispatcher's `SyncWrite` access** (the only change to shipped code):

```typescript
// sync-dispatcher.ts — SyncWrite moves from the top level into `.utils`:
//   Delete:  registry.getByEntity<{ utils: SyncWrite<unknown> }>(name) → c.utils.deleteSynced(id)
//   Ins/Upd: registry.getById<{ utils: SyncWrite<T> }>(key)           → c.utils.writeSynced(data)
// One hop deeper; behavior identical. Lands test-backed in this design, not as silent drift.
```

**Open decisions (grilling §1):**

- **DEC-A1 — schema-less TanStack collection.** The factory does *not* hand its Effect schema to
  TanStack; it uses the `schema?: never` overload. Decoding already happens once at the dispatch
  seam (`sync-dispatcher.ts:71`, `descriptor.schema`), so `writeSynced(data: T)` receives a decoded,
  branded `T`. *Recommend: yes* — avoids the Effect-Schema ↔ StandardSchema bridge, and the gate
  needs no second validation.
- **DEC-A2 — the SQLite↔memory boundary is internal to the library; there is no decode for us to
  do *or* skip.** Verified in `@tanstack/db-sqlite-persistence-core` `persisted.js`
  (`createWrappedSyncConfig`): `persistedCollectionOptions` wraps our `sync` and (a) hydrates the
  in-memory store from `adapter.loadSubset` itself on startup, before our sync's `markReady` fires,
  and (b) intercepts our `write()` calls, persisting them via `applyCommittedTx` *and* forwarding
  them to the in-memory store. So rehydrated rows never enter *our* code as `unknown` — TanStack
  reads back its own JSON, its responsibility, gated by `schemaVersion`. This is **not** a carve-out
  from "validate at boundaries": our only `unknown → T` boundary is the dispatch seam, which we
  decode. (The registry's "an in-process object we put here ourselves" note, now extended across a
  reload by the library, not by us.)
- **TKey = `ModelId`.** Branded string → assignable to `string | number`; `getKey: (e) => e.id`.
  *Recommend: yes.*
- **Surface = nothing beyond `Collection` + `utils: SyncWrite<T>`.** Mounting is `MountRef`'s job;
  optimistic mutation is a later slice. *Recommend: keep it bare.*

---

## §2 — `effectCollectionOptions(...)` (the factory)

The body of `defineCollection`'s `make`. Returns the built `LiveCollection<T>` as an Effect that
registers its own teardown (so `R` carries `Scope`) and requires the persistence base. In *this*
pass there is no network: the `sync` config hydrates (internal, §1/DEC-A2) and `markReady`s; the
catchup/SSE wiring is the transport pass (§5).

```typescript
import { Effect, type Schema, type Scope } from "effect"
import type { ModelId } from "@triargos/live-collection-protocol"
import { PersistenceBase } from "./persistence-base.js"
import { deriveSchemaVersion } from "./schema-version.js"
import type { LiveCollection } from "./live-collection.js"

export const effectCollectionOptions = <T extends object>(args: {
  /** Stable, unique-per-(entity,scope) id for the SQLite table + TanStack collection id.
   *  INJECTED by defineCollection (DEC-A3) — the app never hand-builds it. */
  readonly collectionId: string
  /** The entity schema — used ONLY to derive schemaVersion (DEC-A6) and infer T; never handed to
   *  TanStack, performs no validation (DEC-A4 amended). schemaVersion = deriveSchemaVersion(schema). */
  readonly schema: Schema.Schema<T, any, never>
  /** T → its row key. */
  readonly getKey: (entity: T) => ModelId
}): Effect.Effect<LiveCollection<T>, never, PersistenceBase | Scope.Scope> => Effect.gen(/* …§4 */)
```

Call site (what an app writes once per entity):

```typescript
export const webhookCollection = defineCollection({
  entity:  "Webhook",
  scopeOf: (orgId: OrgId) => orgId,
  // mount carries the injected collectionId; args is the scoped arg. T infers from `schema`.
  make: ({ collectionId }) => effectCollectionOptions({
    collectionId,
    schema: Webhook,
    getKey: (w) => w.id,
  }),
})
```

**Open decisions (grilling §2):**

- **DEC-A3 — `defineCollection` injects `collectionId`; the app never builds it.** The factory needs
  a stable id for the persistence table (`createPersistedTableName`). It must equal one value per
  `(entity, scope)` across mounts. `defineCollection` already mints the `CollectionKey`, so it
  passes the id into `make` via a `mount` object: `make: (mount: { collectionId; args }) => Effect`.
  **Resolved:** id = `serializeKey(key)`. No new string grammar (decision 9), and the raw form is
  never used as an identifier — TanStack's `createPersistedTableName` FNV-1a-hashes the
  `collectionId` into a safe `c_<base32>_<len>` table name, so **arbitrary org ids need no
  sanitizing, lowercasing, or hand-hashing**. **Cost:** changes `define-collection.ts` (`make`
  gains the `mount` param, both overloads); test-backed.
- **DEC-A4 — the factory takes the schema *only* to derive `schemaVersion` + infer `T`, never to
  validate** *(amended in Phase 3)*. Originally schema-free (validation happens at the dispatch seam,
  DEC-A1). Reopened so `schemaVersion` is **auto-derived** from the schema instead of a manual number
  the app must remember to bump (the hosting smell): `schemaVersion = deriveSchemaVersion(String(
  schema.ast))` — FNV-1a over the schema's structural type string, which folds in field **names,
  types, and brands** (a same-named field whose type changed still resets — closing hosting's
  names-only blind spot, which matters under DEC-A2's "trust the local base"). The schema is **not**
  forwarded to `createCollection` (still schema-less, DEC-A1) and runs no validation. Bonus: `T`
  infers from `schema`, so call sites drop the explicit generic. Trade-off: an Effect AST-format
  change could cause a spurious reset on upgrade — a harmless refetch, the right side vs. a *missed*
  change. Verified by `deriveSchemaVersion` behavior tests (same⇒equal; add/remove/rename/retype/
  rebrand⇒different).
- **DEC-A5 — this pass's `sync` is network-free.** It installs the sync-session holder (§4) and
  `markReady`s after the library's internal hydration; catchup + SSE land in the transport pass.
  Keeps the A.3 gate (persist → reload → rehydrate) provable with zero backend. *Recommend: yes.*
- **DEC-A6 — schema evolution = dump-and-rebuild, native, no table bookkeeping of our own.** Pass
  `schemaVersion` (bump on entity-shape change) + `schemaMismatchPolicy: 'sync-present-reset'` (the
  default). On mismatch the lib resets the table *in place* (`collection_reset_epoch++`, same hashed
  name) and re-syncs — so a schema change drops the local copy and a full refetch rebuilds it, with
  **no migrations to write**. This deliberately adopts the library mechanism over porting the old
  `hosting` `collection-manager` bookkeeping (hot-map of `tableHash`, `staleTables` cleanup, batched
  migration window) — that whole-table per-collection bookkeeping is a CLAUDE.md anti-reference. The
  only cache is `CollectionRegistry` (mounts are canonical); reset-in-place means no orphaned tables
  to sweep, so no hot-table of names is needed. *Recommend: yes.*

---

## §3 — `PersistenceBase` (the inner seam)

The shared, app-wide persistence every collection reuses (each passes its own `collectionId`; they
share one DB). Injectable via a tag — `PersistenceBase` — with two layers. The seam sits at the
`PersistedCollectionPersistence` level, **not** the raw driver: `createBrowserWASQLitePersistence`
builds its driver internally from `new BrowserWASQLiteDriver(db)`, and `BrowserWASQLiteDriver` is an
**internal** class (not re-exported; the package `exports` map blocks deep imports), so prod can
never hand us a raw `SQLiteDriver`. The finest *public* seam is the persistence object — so that's
the tag. The node test layer replicates the *full* builder logic over the injected driver — adapter
cache + `resolvePersistenceForCollection` included, not just `{ adapter, coordinator }` (Phase 3
found the short version drops per-collection `schemaVersion`; DEC-A8). Only the driver differs.

```typescript
import { Context, Effect, Layer, Scope } from "effect"
import type { PersistedCollectionPersistence, SQLiteDriver } from "@tanstack/db-sqlite-persistence-core"
import { createSQLiteCorePersistenceAdapter, SingleProcessCoordinator } from "@tanstack/db-sqlite-persistence-core"
import { openBrowserWASQLiteOPFSDatabase, createBrowserWASQLitePersistence } from "@tanstack/browser-db-sqlite-persistence"

export interface PersistenceBaseShape {
  /** The shared TanStack persistence object the factory hands to persistedCollectionOptions. */
  readonly persistence: PersistedCollectionPersistence
}

export class PersistenceBase extends Context.Tag("PersistenceBase")<PersistenceBase, PersistenceBaseShape>() {
  /** Prod: wa-sqlite over OPFS via the browser package's public builder. One DB app-wide,
   *  closed on scope release. Single-tab (SingleProcessCoordinator). */
  static readonly layer: (args: { readonly databaseName: string }) =>
    Layer.Layer<PersistenceBase, never, Scope.Scope>
  //  = Layer.scoped(PersistenceBase, Effect.gen(function* () {
  //      const database = yield* Effect.acquireRelease(
  //        Effect.promise(() => openBrowserWASQLiteOPFSDatabase({ databaseName })),
  //        (db) => Effect.promise(() => db.close?.()),
  //      )
  //      return { persistence: createBrowserWASQLitePersistence({ database, schemaMismatchPolicy: "sync-present-reset" }) }
  //    }))

  /** Test/node: the test supplies only a raw SQLiteDriver (node:sqlite wrapper); the LIB must
   *  replicate createBrowserWASQLitePersistence's FULL logic over it — NOT just { adapter,
   *  coordinator }. The load-bearing part is `resolvePersistenceForCollection`, which mints a
   *  per-collection adapter carrying that collection's schemaVersion (an adapter cache keyed by
   *  policy|schemaVersion); without it the version is dropped and DEC-A6's reset never fires. Library
   *  ships no node driver (frontend-only pin); the driver is test infra. */
  static readonly layerSqliteDriver: (driver: SQLiteDriver) => Layer.Layer<PersistenceBase>
  //  builds: coordinator = new SingleProcessCoordinator(); an adapterCache keyed by `policy|version`;
  //  adapterFor(mode, schemaVersion) = createSQLiteCorePersistenceAdapter({ driver, schemaMismatchPolicy,
  //    ...(schemaVersion === undefined ? {} : { schemaVersion }) }) (cached);
  //  persistence = { ...forCollection("sync-absent", undefined),
  //    resolvePersistenceForCollection: ({mode, schemaVersion}) => forCollection(mode, schemaVersion),
  //    resolvePersistenceForMode: (mode) => forCollection(mode, undefined) }
}
```

Wiring:
- **prod:** `PersistenceBase.layer({ databaseName })`
- **test:** `PersistenceBase.layerSqliteDriver(<node:sqlite driver>)`

**Open decisions (grilling §3):**

- **DEC-A7 — `PersistenceBase` is the injectable tag; the seam is the persistence object, not the
  driver.** A shared, scoped resource (one DB, opened once, closed on release) with two real adapters
  → Tag + layers. The finer raw-`SQLiteDriver` seam is **impossible via public API**
  (`BrowserWASQLiteDriver` is internal + the `exports` map forbids deep imports), so the tag lives one
  level up. It bends decision 3 ("the factory is the *only* seam") — the deliberate exception
  OPFS-can't-test forces. *Answers "injectable via a tag?" — yes, at the persistence level.*
- **DEC-A8 — test supplies a raw `SQLiteDriver` to `layerSqliteDriver`; the lib wires the rest.**
  CLAUDE.md pins the library frontend-only, so the node/`node:sqlite` driver is test infra. The lib
  must replicate `createBrowserWASQLitePersistence`'s **full** logic over that driver — the adapter
  cache + `resolvePersistenceForCollection` (Phase 3 found that `{ adapter, coordinator }` alone drops
  per-collection `schemaVersion`, so the reset never fires). With that, the headless node gate is
  **faithful**: it proves the real persist → reset → rehydrate semantics, and the playground only
  proves "OPFS works here." *Open: node:sqlite (zero-dep, Node ≥22, experimental)
  vs better-sqlite3 (native build).*
- **DEC-A9 — single-tab now, multi-tab deferred.** `createBrowserWASQLitePersistence` already
  defaults to `SingleProcessCoordinator` (no election); the `BrowserCollectionCoordinator` (Broadcast
  Channel leader election across tabs) is opt-in. Defer it. *Recommend: yes.*
- **DEC-A8.1 — node test driver = `node:sqlite`.** Zero-dep, no native build; requires Node ≥22 (the
  repo's toolchain), accepting the "experimental" flag for test-only infra. *Locked.*

## §4 — the sync-session holder + lifetime (how `utils.writeSynced` reaches the sync loop)

`utils.writeSynced`/`deleteSynced` are built at **config-construction** time, but `begin/write/commit`
only exist inside the `sync` closure, which runs at **sync-start**. A `Deferred` bridges the two: the
closure fills it once on start; `writeSynced` awaits it (a write issued before start simply waits).

This is only sound if sync **starts on mount and never tears down while mounted**. The TanStack
source settles how: on the last unsubscribe the collection does *not* pause — it only starts a
**gcTime** timer (`changes.js:124` → `lifecycle.startGCTimer`), and the only thing that ever calls
`sync.cleanup()` is that timer (or an explicit `collection.cleanup()`). `startGCTimer` with a
**non-finite gcTime returns without scheduling** (`lifecycle.js:99-103`), and `startSync()` is
guarded so `sync()` is invoked once. So setting **`gcTime: Infinity`** makes the registry the *sole*
GC: sync starts on mount, stays up with zero subscribers, the session is captured exactly once, and
disposal happens only through the registry's finalizer (`collection.cleanup()`). No keep-alive
subscription (DEC-A10).

```typescript
import { Deferred, Effect, Exit } from "effect"
import type { ModelId } from "@triargos/live-collection-protocol"
import type { SyncWrite } from "../dispatch/sync-write.js"

/** The live handle into a started collection's synced-write path: the begin/write/commit trio the
 *  sync closure captures, wrapped as the two operations our write path needs. `upsert` resolves
 *  insert-vs-update from current membership (the synced store is keyed by `getKey`). */
interface SyncSession<T> {
  readonly upsert: (entity: T) => void  // begin → write({type:"update", value}) → commit  (update upserts; no in-mem read)
  readonly remove: (id: ModelId) => void // begin → write({type:"delete", key:id}) → commit
}

/** Builds the utils-hosted SyncWrite<T> and the `provide` the sync closure calls once on start.
 *  writeSynced/deleteSynced await the session, so order between "collection handed out" and
 *  "sync started" never races. */
const makeSyncWrite = <T>(): Effect.Effect<{
  readonly syncWrite: SyncWrite<T>                     // → utils on the collection
  readonly provide: (session: SyncSession<T>) => void  // ← called inside sync(), plain JS
}> => Effect.gen(function* () {
  const session = yield* Deferred.make<SyncSession<T>>()
  const syncWrite: SyncWrite<T> = {
    writeSynced: (entity) => Deferred.await(session).pipe(Effect.map((s) => s.upsert(entity))),
    deleteSynced: (id)    => Deferred.await(session).pipe(Effect.map((s) => s.remove(id))),
  }
  const provide = (s: SyncSession<T>) => Deferred.unsafeDone(session, Exit.succeed(s)) // sync, idempotent guard
  return { syncWrite, provide }
})
```

Factory body (§2) assembled, sketch:

```typescript
// inside effectCollectionOptions(...):
const { syncWrite, provide } = yield* makeSyncWrite<T>()
const collection = createCollection(persistedCollectionOptions({
  id: collectionId, getKey, schemaVersion,
  startSync: true,        // start sync on mount (so the session is captured + hydration runs)
  gcTime: Infinity,       // DEC-A10 — registry is the sole GC; sync never tears down while mounted
  utils: syncWrite,
  persistence: (yield* PersistenceBase).persistence,
  sync: { sync: ({ begin, write, commit, collection }) => {
    provide(makeSession({ begin, write, commit, collection, getKey })) // capture the trio
    // (markReady is the lib's wrapped one — fires after internal hydration; DEC-A5: no network here)
  }},
}))
yield* Effect.addFinalizer(() => Effect.promise(() => collection.cleanup())) // the only GC
return collection as LiveCollection<T>
// NO preload() — see DEC-A13. startSync kicks hydration in the background; consumers await readiness.
```

**Open decisions (grilling §4):**

- **DEC-A10 — `gcTime: Infinity` makes the registry the sole GC; no keep-alive subscription.**
  TanStack tears sync down only via the gcTime timer (or explicit `cleanup()`); a non-finite gcTime
  schedules nothing (`lifecycle.js:99-103`), and `startSync()` is guarded so `sync()` runs once. So
  `gcTime: Infinity` + `startSync: true` keeps sync active with zero subscribers, and the registry's
  `addFinalizer(() => collection.cleanup())` is the only teardown. This replaces the earlier
  keep-alive-subscription idea — it treated the symptom; this expresses the actual ownership (the
  registry owns the lifetime, not the subscriber-GC). **Must be `Infinity`, not merely large:** a
  finite gcTime lets an idle collection clean up, and `validateCollectionUsable` would auto-restart
  `sync()` → a new `begin/write/commit`, leaving the one-shot `Deferred` (DEC-A11) holding a stale
  session. *Recommend: yes.*
- **DEC-A11 — bridge primitive = one-shot `Deferred<SyncSession<T>>`.** Sound *because* of DEC-A10:
  `gcTime: Infinity` guarantees `sync()` is captured exactly once and never restarts while mounted.
  *Recommend: yes.* (If a future change ever lets sync restart mid-mount — e.g. finite gcTime for
  memory pressure — revisit with a re-provisionable holder like `SubscriptionRef`; flagged, not
  built.)
- **`upsert` = unconditional `write({ type: "update" })`; no membership read** *(resolved in Phase 3)*.
  An external synced `update` upserts an absent key (proven: the gate writes a row into an empty
  collection via `update`, 10/10 green), so the session reads **no in-memory state** — making
  `writeSynced` **readiness-independent**. The dispatcher therefore never needs to `preload` before
  writing, and no readiness gate belongs in `utils` (the wrapper queues mid-hydration writes anyway).
  This deletes the dependency rather than synchronizing on it — strictly better than gating the
  session on `onFirstReady`, which would block the first write per collection.

## Call graph

**Prod (browser / OPFS):**

```
app bootstrap
  ├─ PersistenceBase.layer({ databaseName })        opens ONE wa-sqlite/OPFS DB (shared)
  └─ CollectionRegistry.layer                       owns per-collection child scopes

webhookCollection(orgId)                            → MountRef { key, make }
  └─ yield* ref  →  registry.getOrCreate({ key, make })          (child scope forked here)
        └─ make = effectCollectionOptions({ collectionId: serializeKey(key), getKey, schemaVersion })
             ├─ makeSyncWrite<T>()                  Deferred<SyncSession>; utils = SyncWrite<T>
             ├─ createCollection(persistedCollectionOptions({ …, startSync, gcTime: Infinity, persistence }))
             │     └─ wrapped sync: loadSubset → hydrate in-mem (INTERNAL) → provide(session) → markReady
             └─ addFinalizer(collection.cleanup)    registry child scope = the SOLE gc (DEC-A10)
                  (no preload — startSync hydrates in background; consumers await readiness, DEC-A13)

SyncDispatcher.dispatch(event)                      server-truth (A.5)
  ├─ Insert/Update → getById(key)      → c.utils.writeSynced(data) → session.upsert → begin/write/commit
  │                                       └─ wrapper: applyCommittedTx (SQLite) + forward to in-mem
  └─ Delete        → getByEntity(name) → c.utils.deleteSynced(id)  → session.remove → …

reload (new page)  → mount again → loadSubset returns persisted rows BEFORE any network (the gate)
```

**Test (node:sqlite) — same graph, three swaps only:**

```
PersistenceBase.layerSqliteDriver(<node:sqlite driver>)   ← instead of .layer (OPFS)
no SSE/catchup (DEC-A5)        ← the test calls c.utils.writeSynced directly
"reload" = close the mount's child scope (collection.cleanup) but KEEP the node:sqlite DB handle
           open, then mount again → assert rehydration  (the test owns the DB's lifetime)
```

The only difference between the two is the driver — so the node test exercises the real
persist/hydrate/reset logic (`createSQLiteCorePersistenceAdapter` + `SingleProcessCoordinator`),
and the playground only proves OPFS itself works.

## Test plan (design-first Phase 3 — against this interface only)

- **`effect-collection`** (node:sqlite, `it.live` + `reloadUntil` poll — durability is eventually
  consistent, DEC-A14) — **the A.3 gate, all GREEN**:
  1. *hydrate-from-storage* — `utils.writeSynced(e)` → dispose mount → re-mount on the same DB → `e`
     is present before any network call.
  2. *no full re-list* — there is no `queryFn`; the re-mount populates purely from the persisted base.
  3. *deltas persist + converge* — write on top of an existing base; the latest value wins, durably.
  - `deleteSynced` removes and persists the removal; a repeat delete is idempotent.
  - a **schema change** (different derived `schemaVersion`) on the same `collectionId` → base dropped,
    rebuild starts empty (DEC-A6, end-to-end through `resolvePersistenceForCollection`).
  - *(skipped — write-before-ready)*: with `startSync: true` the session is captured synchronously, so
    the "before the session exists" window the `Deferred` guards can't occur; not worth a contrived test.
- **`schema-version`** (pure, `vitest`) — `deriveSchemaVersion` is deterministic and changes on field
  add/remove/rename, **same-name type change**, and brand change; returns a `uint32`. Asserts the
  *relation* between schemas, not the exact hash (survives an Effect AST-format change).
- **`persistence-base`** (node) — `layerSqliteDriver` yields a persistence with a working
  `resolvePersistenceForCollection` (exercised transitively by the gate's schema-reset slice).
- **`define-collection`** (shipped-code change) — `make` receives `mount.collectionId =
  serializeKey(key)`; global vs scoped overloads still type-check (`@ts-expect-error` on phantom-arg
  misuse).
- **`sync-dispatcher`** (the relocation) — the existing 17 tests stay green after the `.utils` hop;
  add one asserting `writeSynced`/`deleteSynced` are reached through `.utils`.
- **playground** (browser, manual/Playwright smoke) — the OPFS DB persists across a *real* reload:
  the one thing node can't prove.

Out of scope here (own passes): catchup/SSE transport, optimistic-mutation reconciliation (DEC-11),
multi-tab coordination.

**Phase-3 findings (all 4 gate slices GREEN, 0/10 flaky). The happy-path step-1 test masked two real
issues that the deltas/delete/schema-reset slices exposed — corrections to earlier claims:**
- *Insert-vs-update (was "unknown b"):* unconditional `update` **does** insert in-memory, even for an
  absent key — so write-*type* was never the problem. (Earlier I wrongly concluded the gate "proved
  upsert"; step 1 only ever inserted into an *empty* store.) `writeSynced` stays unconditional
  `update`.
- *Write durability is fire-and-forget (corrects "unknown a"):* the wrapped `commit` does
  `void runtime.persistAndBroadcastExternalSyncTransaction(...)` — the persist is **async and not
  awaited**, and the alpha exposes **no durability handle** on a sync-wrapped collection (`utils` is
  only our `writeSynced`/`deleteSynced`; `cleanup()` does not flush). The persist *survives* dispose
  and completes a few ticks later — it isn't killed, just not waited on. So the gate is **eventually
  consistent**: tests use `it.live` + a `reloadUntil` poll (remount-and-read until the state settles)
  and serialize each write phase's persistence before the next, so an orphaned persist can't clobber
  a later cross-remount write. Production durability is a *(rows + `lastSyncId`)* property — secured
  by persisting the cursor in the collection's metadata (same transaction as the rows) so reload is
  self-consistent and catchup heals the tail (DEC-A14, transport pass). We do **not** try to force
  per-write durability (no handle exists; it fights the alpha's design).
- *`layerSqliteDriver` must replicate the full browser builder, not just `{ adapter, coordinator }`
  (corrects DEC-A8):* the per-collection `schemaVersion` reaches the adapter only via
  `resolvePersistenceForCollection` (an adapter cache keyed by `policy|schemaVersion`). My first
  hand-built version omitted it, so the version was dropped and the schema-reset never fired. Fixed
  by replicating `createBrowserWASQLitePersistence`'s logic over the injected driver.

## Changes to shipped code

- `registry/define-collection.ts` — `make` gains a `mount: { collectionId; args }` param;
  `defineCollection` fills `collectionId = serializeKey(key)` (both overloads). *(DEC-A3)*
- `dispatch/sync-dispatcher.ts` — read the synced-write path via `.utils`
  (`getById<{ utils: SyncWrite<T> }>` / `getByEntity<…>`, then `c.utils.writeSynced` / `.deleteSynced`). *(§1)*
- `package.json` — add `@tanstack/browser-db-sqlite-persistence` + its `@journeyapps/wa-sqlite` peer
  (both pin `@tanstack/db@0.6.7` — no core bump). Node test uses built-in `node:sqlite` (no dep).
- `CLAUDE.md` decision 2 — correct the import path: `persistedCollectionOptions` lives in
  `@tanstack/browser-db-sqlite-persistence`, **not** `@tanstack/db` core (the rest of decision 2 was right).

## Decisions log (load-bearing — do not re-litigate without a new reason)

- **DEC-A1** Schema-less TanStack collection; decode happens once at the dispatch seam.
- **DEC-A2** The SQLite↔memory boundary is *internal to the library* — no decode of ours to do or skip.
- **DEC-A3** `defineCollection` injects `collectionId = serializeKey(key)`; lib FNV-hashes it → no org-id rules.
- **DEC-A4** *(amended)* The factory takes the schema **only** to auto-derive `schemaVersion` + infer `T`, never to validate; `deriveSchemaVersion(String(schema.ast))`.
- **DEC-A5** This pass's `sync` is network-free (catchup/SSE is the transport pass).
- **DEC-A6** Schema evolution = native dump-and-rebuild (`schemaVersion` + `sync-present-reset`); no table bookkeeping.
- **DEC-A7** `PersistenceBase` is the injectable tag at the persistence level (raw-driver seam impossible — internal class).
- **DEC-A8 / A8.1** Test injects a raw `SQLiteDriver`; driver = `node:sqlite`; faithful headless gate.
  `layerSqliteDriver` must replicate `createBrowserWASQLitePersistence` *fully* — incl. the adapter
  cache + `resolvePersistenceForCollection` that threads per-collection `schemaVersion` (else DEC-A6's
  reset never fires). `{ adapter, coordinator }` alone is insufficient.
- **DEC-A9** Single-tab (`SingleProcessCoordinator`) now; multi-tab deferred.
- **DEC-A10** `gcTime: Infinity` → the registry is the sole GC; no keep-alive subscription.
- **DEC-A11** One-shot `Deferred<SyncSession<T>>` bridges config-time utils to run-time sync (sound via A10).
- **DEC-A13** **The factory `startSync: true` but never `preload()`.** `startSync` *starts* sync on
  mount (non-blocking — kicks local-base hydration in the background); `preload()` would *await* full
  hydration before `make` returns, blocking every mount (bad UX, worse for large bases). Consumers
  handle readiness: `useLiveQuery` reflects loading state; the dispatcher's writes are queued during
  hydration; the session is captured synchronously on start so `writeSynced` never races. `startSync`
  itself **is** required (unlike hosting, which is lazy via `startSyncImmediate` in its mutation
  handlers) because **our persistence is coupled to sync** — `persistedCollectionOptions` makes the
  `begin/write/commit` path the *only* door to the persistence layer, so the dispatcher can't persist
  server truth to a mounted collection unless its sync is running. Hosting's persistence (Dexie) is
  decoupled, so it could afford to be lazy; we can't. Verified: gate test moves its readiness await
  (`collection.preload()`) into the test, 10/10 green.
- **DEC-A14** **Synced writes are fire-and-forget / eventually-consistent; durability is a
  (rows + cursor) property, not a per-write guarantee.** The alpha's wrapped `commit` `void`s the
  async persist and exposes no durability handle. We don't fight it: `writeSynced` returns once the
  in-memory write is applied; the persist completes shortly after (it survives dispose). Reload
  durability is secured in the transport pass by persisting `lastSyncId` in the collection's metadata
  (same tx as the rows) so rows+cursor are mutually consistent and catchup heals any tail. The offline
  gate, lacking catchup, verifies *eventual* persistence by polling (`it.live` + `reloadUntil`).
- **DEC-A12** *(transport-pass scope; recorded now)* **Source strategy is snapshot-and-tail, not
  catchup-from-zero.** On mount the source slot chooses: if the local base was **never bootstrapped**,
  or the durable "last bootstrapped at" is **older than a per-collection threshold**, do a **full
  refetch from a list/snapshot endpoint** (`BootstrapSource`) and replace the base; otherwise
  **catchup** incrementally from `lastSyncId`. Then SSE for live deltas. Rationale: `catchup(from: 0)`
  forces the server to scan + squash the *entire* event log (O(total events) vs a list's O(live
  rows)), and once the log is retention-pruned it *cannot* reconstruct cold state at all — so a
  snapshot endpoint is a correctness requirement, not just an optimization. The freshness threshold is
  **our durable metadata** (a `lastBootstrapAt` alongside `lastSyncId`), consistent with decision 5
  (freshness is ours) — it is *not* the framework's `staleTime` (which resets on reload and is
  rejected for gating catchup). Consequence: the factory gains `bootstrapFn` + a staleness config in
  the transport pass; this offline pass is unaffected.

**CLAUDE.md cross-refs:** bends decision **3** (the factory is no longer the *only* seam — `PersistenceBase`
sits inside it, DEC-A7); honors decision **9** (no string grammar — DEC-A3); leans on decisions **2/5**
(persistence base + durable cursor) and protocol **DEC-6/DEC-11/DEC-12**.
